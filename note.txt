js Api


AJAX
----

1-xmlHttps
2-fetch
3-async await      -  we can directly store in a variable using async and await


useEffect  -  hook used to call function at the starting time of components

Redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom          -library used for Redirection

BrowserRouter        - root component selector
Route                - for path setting
Routes               - if we use more than one path


Params
------

-useParams  - hook used to access Params



REDUX
-----
props drilling -  data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component
                  have any issue

                - props drilling occures during coupling many connection between parent and child  (COUPLING)


 to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all compponents independent 

 so react indroduced a state management technology - REDUX               


                               app.js
                               ------

        restaurent.js                             header

operating hours             review
--------------              -------


a component can access file from store.js(parent) but cannot edit so we can use REDUX
access data from store.js then dispatch to action file. the action file did all the logics. the result called payload 
the payload transferd to reducer and reducer update the file 


libraries
---------
   REDUX
   react-REDUX
   redux-thunk


axios
